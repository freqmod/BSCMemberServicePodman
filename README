Podman setup for development / running BÃ¥rdar Swing Clubs medlemssider in debug mode.

The scripts currently are set up with running podman as root since the device i am using
Orange Pi 5 doesn't have stable support for recent enough linux kernels to use podman as an user.

It is expected that a medlemssider repo adapted for running in sqlite si checked out in a MemberService subdirectory.
Some paths may need to be changed in the scripts.

mkdir persistent
cd persistent
sqlite3 sqlitedb.db "VACUUM;" 

If you still get errors about the database ensure that the file is readable and writable by the user id 
(inside podman) that runs the server (or just chmod 666).
